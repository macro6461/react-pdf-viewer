## React PDF Viewer

This is the repository for React PDF Viewer, an application leveraging both react-pdf-js Ant Design to give a robust and easy to implement PDF viewer. 

PdfViewer accepts three props: `visible`, `onCancel`, and `pdf`. 

`visible` is responsible for controlling the Modal visibility. 
`onCancel` is the functional prop passed to allow the user to exit the modal.
`pdf` is the actual pdf file that will be passed down to the react-pdf-js instance in PdfViewer.
